If you're just a normal person who's stumbled upon this repo, please, [go buy the game](https://www.amazon.com/Crash-Games-Dead-Drop/dp/B012B87LM8). It's great.

If you insist on printing your own copy, print the file `PDFs/full set.pdf`.  If you want the cards to look nice, try a technique such as [this one](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/490643/making-cards-youll-never-use-your-old-method-again).
